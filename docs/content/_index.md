Grizzly empowers you to provision dashboards using the outputs of your existing as-code workflows. Whether you use Terraform or Pulumi, Waypoint or Dagger, Grizzly is the essential last-mile for declarative, as code observability of your existing as-code workflows.

<p style="text-align: center;">Code, deploy and observe, together.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Grizzly: it ties the room together</p>

You’ve already built consistent, repeatable patters, in your code, in your pipelines, in your deployment systems. Now you can do the same, as code with your observability solution.

The future is yours.

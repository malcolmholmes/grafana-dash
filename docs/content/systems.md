Typical observability systems are commonly composed of multiple
systems. Resources need to be configured across these systems.

Grizzly is currently able to manage these resources:

| System | Resource |
| --- | --- |
| Grafana | Dashboard |
| Grafana | Folder |
| Grafana | Datasource |
| Prometheus | Alerting rule |
| Prometheus | Recording rule |
| Synthetic Monitoring | Check |

title: "What is Grizzly?"
---
Grafana Grizzly is a command line tool that allows you to manage your
observability resources with code.

Now you can define your dashboards, alerting and recording rules, etc, all
from within your codebase.

You can build Grizzly into your continuous deployment pipelines, meaning
whenever you deploy your application, your observability is updated too.
